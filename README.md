## 🔄 Updating the Absorb Theme

Want to keep Absorb fresh with the latest updates? Here's how you can easily pull the newest version of the theme using our handy shell script.

### Step 1: Download the Update Script (you shouldn't need to if you're a first downloader)

Grab it from here: [updater.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheAmanM/absorb/refs/heads/main/themes/updater.sh)

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x updater.sh
```

### Step 3: Run the Script

```bash
./updater.sh
```

It will automatically fetch the latest `Absorb-color-theme.json` and drop it in your current folder.

### Optional: Replace the Existing Theme File

If you've installed Absorb manually, just move the new file into the appropriate directory:

```bash
mv Absorb-color-theme.json ~/.vscode/extensions/absorb/themes/
```

Done! You're now basking in the freshest darkness 🌑
